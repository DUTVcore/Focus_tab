> **"Stop Simping. Start Coding. Get Hired."**

## 📖 Introduction

**Focus Tab** is a Chrome Extension built to replace the boring default "New Tab" page.

This project was born from a personal need as a DUT student: I needed a minimalist workspace, eliminating distractions from Social Media/Short Videos, to laser-focus on my goal: **getting hired by my Junior year**.

The latest version ("Reborn") transforms your browser into a true "cockpit" with a fixed Sidebar, integrated schedule, and inspiring dynamic backgrounds.

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Lightweight Core:** Written in Vanilla JS (pure), no heavy Frameworks. Absolute RAM optimization.
* **🧭 Smart Sidebar:** Fixed right-side toolbar (Opera GX style), providing quick access to Calendar, Alarm, and Settings without cluttering the main screen.
* **📅 Interactive Calendar:** Integrated Popup Calendar right on the New Tab for quick date checking.
* **🎯 Goal Reminder:** Always displays your most important goal right in the center. Never forget what you are grinding for.
* **🎬 Dynamic Background:**
    * Supports static images (JPG/PNG).
    * **Supports Video Backgrounds (MP4/WebM):** Allows using videos (e.g., Toothless Dancing, Cyberpunk City...) to boost the "cool" factor.
* **📝 Fast Todo-list:** Stores tasks in LocalStorage. Data persists even after closing the browser.
* **⚙️ Quick Settings:** Glassmorphism-style modal settings, allowing you to change backgrounds, fonts, and sizes in a snap.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Backdrop-filter).
* **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Storage:** Chrome LocalStorage API.
